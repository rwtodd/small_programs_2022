# Small Programs 2022

I make a repo every year for little bits of code that don't deserve
independent source-control treatment.

- **adjust\-smartquotes**: tiny perl script to convert unicode quotes to TeX quotes.
- **bf\-compiler**: a brainf--k compiler in GNU-Prolog with a few optimization passes.
- **double\-cola**: a programming challenge that's not hard if you know about logarithms
- **eng\-qbl**: just playing with gematria in GNU-prolog + DCG grammars.
- **grab\-flacs**: powershell script to pull the .FLAC addresses from a web page, and then schedule `BITS`-tasks to download them. 
- **hw4\-convert**: code to extract the text of books in obsolete/forgotten HW4 format. GNU-Prolog, and it does work except on long books GNU-Prolog runs into memory issues on the code I've written.
- **lua_coroutine**:  just reminding myself how lua coroutines work
- **ncurses\-256c**: playing with 256-color support in ncurses
- **prolog\-play**: playing with GNU-Prolog
- **snoopy\-cal**: a C implementation of the famous "1969 Snoopy Calendar" program mentioned in "Real Programmers Don't Use Pascal."
- **zip\-2\-7z**: powershell script to recompress .ZIP files to .7z, and a script to re-run `par` on directories.
