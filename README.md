# Small Programs 2022

I make a repo every year for little bits of code that don't deserve
independent source-control treatment.

- **grab\-flacs**: powershell script to pull the .FLAC addresses from a web page, and then schedule `BITS`-tasks to download them. 
- **snoopy\-cal**: a C implementation of the famous "1969 Snoopy Calendar" program mentioned in "Real Programmers Don't Use Pascal."
- **zip\-2\-7z**: powershell script to recompress .ZIP files to .7z, and a script to re-run `par` on directories.
