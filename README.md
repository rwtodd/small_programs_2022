# Small Programs 2022

I make a repo every year for little bits of code that don't deserve
independent source-control treatment.

- **adjust\-smartquotes**: tiny perl script to convert unicode quotes to TeX quotes.
- **bf\-compiler**: a brainf--k compiler in GNU-Prolog with a few optimization passes.
- **grab\-flacs**: powershell script to pull the .FLAC addresses from a web page, and then schedule `BITS`-tasks to download them. 
- **ncurses-256c**: playing with 256-color support in ncurses
- **snoopy\-cal**: a C implementation of the famous "1969 Snoopy Calendar" program mentioned in "Real Programmers Don't Use Pascal."
- **zip\-2\-7z**: powershell script to recompress .ZIP files to .7z, and a script to re-run `par` on directories.
